<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<span>Basketball is my main hobby. I've loved it all of my life.</span>
<h3>The National Basketball Association (NBA)</h3>
<p>I have a high passion for the NBA and all that goes on within its sphere.<br/>It's something that never tires me.</p>
<span>My favorite team is the Lakers. Even though they are trash at the moment.</span>
